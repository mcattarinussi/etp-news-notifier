# ETP News Notifier

Notification service for [entetutelapesca.it - Informazioni ambientali](http://www.entetutelapesca.it/cms/it/istituzionale/amministrazione-trasparente/20info_ambientali/) news. The registered phone numbers will receive a SMS when a new article has been published.

[ETP (Ente Tutela Pesca)](http://www.entetutelapesca.it/cms/it/) is the organization that regulates sport fishing in the Friuli Venezia Giulia region (Italy). They don't provide a newsletter to subscribe to, so the only way to know if something was released is to constantly check the news page on their website. This service automates this procedure by regularly checking the website for new articles: when one is detected the registered phone numbers will be notified with a text message.
